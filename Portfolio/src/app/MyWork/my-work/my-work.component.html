            The problem she was solving was that she had to give people one
            website where they can view more than one charity and make donations
            to different charities from one site instead of having to navigate
            to several different websites. Her responsibilities included
            designing and creating the frontend for the project, creating a
            database for the project. She also had to connect the database to
            the backend of the project and create an endpoint to access the
            database in the frontend. The technology used here was ASP.Net,
            .NetCore, SQL Server and VueJS.

            <p class="projectParagraph">The industry of the project was wildlife. The problem Pam was trying to solve was that she had to give regular visitors of South African National Parks an easier way to track the movement of animals in different National Parks so that they can easily locate these animals on their visit at the National Park. Her responsibilities included doing research on integrating relational data with unstructured data, doing data mining from Facebook to get unstructured data from National Park Groups to use for tracking animals, creating the frontend for the artifact, creating a relational database to store relational data, to connect the database to the frontend of the artifact. 
                The tools that were used for this project are C#, SQL Server, and Python.

            The hippo advisory system is a platform used to assist and advise
            customers on the best health insurance package available for them.
            The goal of this project is to rewrite the system that currently
            exists to make it more efficient, accessible and user friendly.
            Pamâ€™s role in this project is to perform updates and queries on the
            database and to create endpoints that can be used by the frontend
            team to access the data they need from the database. Pam is also
            responsible for updating the queues associated with each API call
            and to occasionally store certain information in a cache.
            Technologies used for this project include .net core, SQL Server,
            RabbitMQ, Redis, Rancher, Magic Draw, Azure Functions, Kong, Docker,
            Xunit.
